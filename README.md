**Features:**

Provides one bistable latching relay channel. Connectors are provided for a link LED and a local button to latch and unlatch the relay.
A dual voltage isolated power supply mounts over the top of the latching relay. The relay is capable of switching  a 16 Amp resistive load at 250VAC, or
a 20 Amp resistive load at 125VAC. See relay data sheet for further details. There are screw terminals for attaching the AC wiring  at the rear of the board (behind the power supply).
